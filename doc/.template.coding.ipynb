    "\n",
    "When IMP writes restraints to RMF files, only basic information is included - namely\n",
    " * *static* information (that does not change during the course of a simulation): the name of the restraint, and the particles it acts on; and\n",

    "We can add extra static or dynamic information to the RMF file, by overriding the ``~IMP.Restraint.get_static_info`` or ``~IMP.Restraint.get_dynamic_info`` methods, respectively. Each returns an ``IMP::RestraintInfo`` object which is a simple list of key:value pairs. Here we'll add the force constant (which is static information) to the RMF file by declaring the method in the [C++ header file](https://github.com/salilab/imp_coding_tutorial/tree/main/modules/foo/include/MyRestraint2.h), `include/MyRestraint2.h`:\n",

    "> separated by spaces, e.g. \"force constant\" rather than \"ForceConstant\".\n",
